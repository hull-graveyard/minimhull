# MinimHull - A minimal [hull.io][hio] application

Download or clone this application to bootstrap your [hull.io][hio] project.

## What is included ?

Almost nothing, only the necessary! In greater details, you will find an `index.html` that runs a [hull.io][hio] application, creates a test user and a comment on a "TestObject" [entity](http://hull.io/docs/social/entities)

## Requirements

* A [hull.io][hio] account.
  If you don't have one, you can [register now for free][dashboard]
* The credentials for an application, which you can get in the App's page for your [dashboard][dashboard]
* An HTTP server, to serve the files included in this repository. If you're not sure how to do it, check out [our guide](http://hull.io/docs/apps/serve)

## Getting started

In `index.html`, replace:

* `YOUR_APP_ID` with the **Application ID** of your hull application.
* `YOUR_ORGANIZATION_URL` with your **Organization URL**, found in your [dashboard][dashboard].
